# Canny-Edge-Detection
This project implements the Canny Edge Detection algorithm to detect edges in grayscale images and, optionally, perform template matching. The process involves multiple stages, including Gaussian filtering, gradient calculation, non-maximal suppression, and edge-linking using hysteresis. The algorithm's effectiveness is evaluated on sample images, highlighting performance variations across different sigma values.
